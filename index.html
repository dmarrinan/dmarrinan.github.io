            Data Analyst with experience working on challenging, collaborative, multidisciplinary projects with a wide range of applications. 
            My degree in Engineering Physics from The Ohio State University gave me a broad background in math and science and taught me problem-solving skills that can be applied to almost any situation.
    </p>

    <p>
            During my tenure working at the Air Force Research Laboratory and Booz Allen Hamilton I developed numerical models, analyzed large data sets, performed complex curve fitting and to built data visualization GUIs. 
            Gaining such robust experiences helped me to develop technical and communication skills along with the ability to work collaboratively as part of a technical team. 
            Currently expanding my knowledge and skill sets of data analytics and visualizations with more relevant technologies for business. 
            Looking for opportunities on a collaborative, curious, and committed team to tackle challenging, multidisciplinary problems.
